        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>edtFTPj/PRO is installed either from a ZIP archive (an MSI installer will soon be available for Windows platforms).
        <p>
        <p>The ZIP archive contains all the required files. There are no
            external dependencies so the archive may be extracted to any location,
            as long as its directory structure is maintained. A good starting
            point after extraction is the doc/index.html file.
        <p>
        <p>To use the library, <i>edtftpj-pro.jar</i> and <a href="howtousethelicensefile.html">license.jar</a> (found in the lib directory) must be in your CLASSPATH</p>
