    <h1>Directory Commands</h1>
    <p>FTP supports a variety of directory-related commands.</p>
    <p>Directories can be created (MKD), removed (RMD), or changed into (CWD, CDUP). </p>
    <p>Two types of directory listings can be made with FTP.</p>
    <p>The LIST method obtains a list of files (and possibly directories). If a directory is specified, the server returns a list of files in the directory, together with system specific information about the files. 
        The file information sent will vary depending on the server system. The data type should be set to ASCII for this file name list. If no directory is specified, details of the current working directory 
        listing are sent.
    </p>
    <p>The NAME LIST (NLST) method is similar to LIST, but only file names are returned. No other information about the files is sent. Again, the data type should be set to ASCII.</p>
