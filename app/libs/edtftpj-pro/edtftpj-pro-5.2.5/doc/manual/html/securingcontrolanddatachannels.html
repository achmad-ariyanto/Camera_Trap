    <h1>Securing Control and Data Channels</h1>
    <p>The reader may be aware that FTP operates with two types of channels: <i>control</i> and <i>data</i>. Only one control-channel is used in each session, but several data-channels may be used - one for each data transfer.  
        The AUTH command only secures the control-channel.  Data- channels are not secured until PBSZ and PROT commands are issued.  These commands tell the server whether or not subsequent data-channels should 
        be secure.
    </p>
    <p>A basic assumption of RFC2228 is that a client should be allowed to connect to a server in normal plain text mode and then be able to switch to a secure protocol upon request.  
        This switch is done when the client issues an AUTH command at which time the client and the server negotiate a secure connection.  After the switch, all FTP commands are encrypted, but importantly, 
        data is not encrypted unless further commands are provided.
    </p>
    <p>Ford-Hutchinson takes a major departure from the RFC when securing the data-channel, but that is largely beyond the scope of this document.</p>
