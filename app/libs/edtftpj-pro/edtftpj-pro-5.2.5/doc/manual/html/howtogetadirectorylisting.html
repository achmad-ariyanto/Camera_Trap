        <h1>How to get a directory listing</h1>
        <p>There are two basic ways to get a list of the files in a particular directory on an FTP server. The simpler way gets the names of the files using the
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#dir%28%29">dir()</a> method:
        </p>
        <p>This results in the files array containing the name of the files and directories in the current working directory on the server.</p>
        <p>FTP servers can return more information than just the names of the files and directories. This information can be returned as an array of
            strings by using an overloaded <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#dir%28java.lang.String,%20boolean%29">dir()</a>
            method. The 'full' boolean flag must be set to true to get the full listing:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">string[] descriptions = ftp.dir("mydirname", true);</code></pre>
        <p>For convenience, the detailed file and directory information can be interpreted and returned as an object, in the 
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#dirDetails%28java.lang.String%29">dirDetails()</a> method:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">FTPFile[] files = ftp.dirDetails(".");</code></pre>
        <p>This method returns an array of</span></font> <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPFile.html">FTPFile</a> objects containing information
            about the files in the directory - details such as the size of the file and whether or not it is a directory.
        </p>
        <p>If a listing of a directory other than the current working directory is required it is recommended that the remote working directory be changed
            to that directory, as described in <a href="howtochangedirectories.html">How to change directories</a>.
            The relative or absolute path may be passed to either method, but some FTP servers do not support this feature. In these cases changing directories should work.
        </p>
        <h4>Changing locale</h4>
        <p>Sometimes the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#dirDetails%28java.lang.String%29">dirDetails()</a> method will fail with a ParseException, citing a date string that it cannot interpret. This is
            usually because the FTP server is in a different locale to the client. It may be returning month names that cannot be understood in the client's locale. For example, an FTP server in a German locale will
            return German month names, which cannot be interpreted by a client in a locale that uses English. To solve this, the server's locale should be set in the client, via the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#setParserLocale%28java.util.Locale%29">setParserLocale</a>
            method:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.setParserLocale(Locale.GERMAN);</code></pre>
        <h4>Custom parsers</h4>
        <p>Unix, Windows and VMS file listing parsers are supplied and should cover most scenarios. If a server is encountered that does not have a supported format, a custom parser can
            be written for that server. To do this, the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPFileParser.html">FTPFileParser</a> interface must be implemented. Contact EDT if you would like a custom parser
            written for you. To force the use of this parser (or of an existing parser), use:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#setFTPFileFactory%28com.enterprisedt.net.ftp.FTPFileFactory%29">setFTPFileFactory</a>(new FTPFileFactory(new MyCustomerParser()));</code></pre>
        <p>All methods described above are supported in the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html">FTPClient</a>, <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssl/SSLFTPClient.html">SSLFTPClient</a>,
            and <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/pro/ProFTPClient.html">ProFTPClient</a> classes.
            Note that setParserLocale is not supported in the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html">SSHFTPClient</a> class.
