        <h1>How to upload, download and delete a file</h1>
        <p>Uploading, downloading and deletion of files is all done through simple method calls on the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html">FTPClient</a> class. All methods described below are also supported in the 
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssl/SSLFTPClient.html">SSLFTPClient</a>, 
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/pro/ProFTPClient.html">ProFTPClient</a> and 
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html">SSHFTPClient</a> classes.
        </p>
        <h4>Uploading Files</h4>
        <p>Uploading of a file is done by the following method-call:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#put(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)">put(localFilePath, remoteFileName)</a>;</code></pre>
        <p>This method uploads the file specified by the first argument and saves it on the server with the name specified by the second
            argument. If the file is already present on the server then it is usually overwritten, though this depends on the server configuration.
        </p>
        <p>File appending is also supported, whereby the contents of the local file are appended to the end of the remote file. Appending is done by passing true as a third parameter to the put() method:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#put(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20boolean)">put(localFilePath, remoteFileName, true)</a>;</code></pre>
        <h4>Downloading Files</h4>
        <p>Downloading of a file is done by the following method-call:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#get(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)">get(localFilePath, remoteFileName)</a>;</code></pre>
        <p>This method downloads the file specified by the second argument and saves it locally with the name specified by the first
            argument. If the file is already present on the local storage medium then it is overwritten.
        </p>
        <h4>Deleting Files</h4>
        <p>A file may be deleted by calling the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/FTPClient.html#delete(java.lang.String)">delete()</a> method.</p>
        <h4>Notes:</h4>
        <p>(1) It is often useful to transfer data directly to and from memory rather than files. The topic <a href= 
            "howtotransferstreams.html">How to transfer streams and byte-arrays</a> explains how to do this.</p>
