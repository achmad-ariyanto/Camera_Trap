        <h1>Obtaining Keys and Certificates</h1>
        <p>A private-public key-pair is easy to generate.  Likewise, an "uncertified" certificate may be generated with little effort, but obtaining a trustworthy certificate from a CA necessarily requires some work, 
            time, and (usually) cost.  It involves interacting with the CA to prove identity, and waiting for the CA to digitally sign the certificate.
        </p>
        <p>Alternatively OpenSSL may be used.  The reader is referred to the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/keys.txt">OpenSSL Key HOWTO</a> for instructions on generating key-pairs and to the 
            <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/certificates.txt">OpenSSL Certificate HOWTO</a> for generating certificates.  
            It is recommended that keys with a length of at least 768 bits are used. OpenSSL may be obtained from <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/">http://www.openssl.org/source/</a> or
