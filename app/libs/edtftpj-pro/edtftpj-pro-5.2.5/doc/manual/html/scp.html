    <h1>SCP - Secure Copy</h1>
    <p>Since the early days of SSH, file transfers have been supported through a command called SCP.  This command simply securely copies files or directories between remote computers.  
        It provides no other file operations such as listing, deleting, renaming, and directory navigation. 
    </p>
    <p>SCP itself does not provide authentication and security - it relies on the underlying protocol, usually SSH. </p>
    <p>edtFTPj/PRO supports SCP. You can download a free trial of <b>CompleteFTP</b>, a Windows SCP server, from <a href="http://www.enterprisedt.com/products/completeftp/overview.html" target="_blank">this link</a>. </p>
