        <h1>How to use SFTP (with client validation - password authentication)</h1>
        <p>The topic <a href="howtousesftpintroduction.html">How to use SFTP (introduction)</a> describes the SFTP features of <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html">SSHFTPClient</a>. 
            This topic demonstrates the use of SFTP with the simplest form of client validation - password authentication.
        </p>
        <p>You should ensure that the server's public keys are loaded by the client as described in <a href="howtousesftpwithservervalidationknownhosts.html">How to use SFTP (with server validation - known hosts))</a>, 
            or you may want to <a href="howtouseftpswithoutservervalidation.html">switch off server validation</a> to get started.
        </p>
        <p>Client authentication can be either by password, by public/private keys, or by keyboard-interactive authentication. </p>
        <p>Password authentication is generally the easiest to try first, although some SFTP servers are set up to disallow password authentication, in which case the connection attempt will 
            fail unless password authentication is enabled in the server configuration file.To use password authentication, call the 
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#setAuthentication%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29">setAuthentication</a> method before calling connect, 
            supplying the username and password:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#setAuthentication%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29">setAuthentication</a>(username, password);
ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#connect%28%29">connect</a>();</code></pre>
        <p>The user name and password should be that of the SSH user that the client is logging in as. </p>
        <p>Note that some SFTP servers are set up to disallow password authentication, in which case the connection attempt will fail unless password authentication is enabled in the server configuration file.</p>
