    <h1>How to use the license file</h1>
    <p>edtFTPj/PRO uses a license key to control access to the key classes. All key classes check that a valid license is available, otherwise an exception is thrown.</p>
    <p>The license is supplied as either two strings (an <i>owner</i> string and <i>license</i> key), or as a <i>license.jar</i> file (for trial editions and for customers prior to 2.0.1).</p>
    <p>The license is set via the setLicenseDetails() method in the <i>com.enterprisedt.util.license.License</i> class. This method should be called prior to using the API in your application. Its use is shown below:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-java">License.setLicenseDetails("myownerstring","mylicensekey");</code></pre>
    <p>If a <i>license.jar</i> is being used (e.g. for the trial edition), it must be in the CLASSPATH of the application using edtFTPj/PRO. The trial version includes a <i>license.jar</i> file with an expiry
        date at least 30 days in the future.
    </p>
    <p>When you purchase the product, you will receive a permanent license consisting of the owner string and the license key. Use <i>License.setLicenseDetails("myownerstring", "mylicensekey")</i> to apply this license. Once this is done
        the trial <i>license.jar</i> is no longer required. 
	</p>
    <p>If you prefer to continue using the license.jar format, you can edit it as follows:
		<ol>
		 <li>Rename license.jar to license.jar.zip</li>
		 <li>Open license.jar.zip using a tool such as <a hrer="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank">7-zip</a> that allows you to edit files within zip files.</li>
		 <li>Open <i>edtlicense.properties</i> for editing.</li>
		 <li>Replace the license.owner value with your own "myownerstring", so you have "license.owner=myownerstring"</li>
		 <li>Replace the license.key value with your own "mylicensekey".</li>
		 <li>Close the zip file and rename back to license.jar.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
    <p>
		You now should have a license.jar file containing your own license details which can be used instead of the trial license.jar.
    </p>
    <p>
	If you use a trial <i>license.jar</i> after its expiry date, an exception will be thrown indicating that the license has expired.
