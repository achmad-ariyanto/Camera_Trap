        <h1>How to get help</h1>
        <p>
            Customers and those trialing a product may <a href="https://enterprisedt.com/support/index.html">open a support ticket</a>.
            <b>Before doing so</b>, please check the <a href="https://www.enterprisedt.com/support/">site resources</a>, as
            your question may be answered there. Also see <a href="howtodiagnoseproblems.html">how to diagnose problems</a>.
        </p>
        <p><u>When contacting support with a problem, always include the following:</u></p>
        <ul>
            <li>a stack trace (if an exception is being thrown)</li>
            <li>the section of the <u>DEBUG level</u> log file that illustrates
                the problem (see <a href="howtosetuplogging.html">How to set up logging</a>)
            </li>
            <li>the initial part of the log file that displays versioning information and your classpath</li>
            <li>the type of server you are accessing (include the version if possible), and, if possible, the 
                server log file.
            </li>
            <li>the version of edtFTPj/PRO you are using, if that is not shown in the log file</li>
            <li>a copy of the Filezilla (or WinSCP) debug log file for a successful connection. If you can't get Filezilla or other clients to work
                correctly with your server, resolve this first before contacting us!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please include as much information as possible; it will save you the time that it takes us to ask for it.</p>
        <p>Please check your spam folders for our replies if you haven't seen a reply from us within 24 hours.</p>
