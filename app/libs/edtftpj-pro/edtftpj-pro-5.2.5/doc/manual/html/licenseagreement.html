        <p>6.1.2. it is not technically practicable to guarantee software to be error-free, and you agree that if any such errors are found to exist they shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement</p>
        <p>6.1.3. the Software is provided for use by you as an expert, and that where you decide to incorporate the Software in an application created by you, it is solely your responsibility to carry out all appropriate testing and to determine

        <p>6.7. IF ANY EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION CONTAINED IN THIS LICENSE SHALL BE HELD TO BE INVALID FOR ANY REASON AND WE BECOME LIABLE FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT MAY LAWFULLY BE LIMITED, SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY YOU FOR THE
            SOFTWARE.
        </p>
        <p>6.8. We do not exclude liability for death or personal injury to the extent only that it arises as a result of our negligence or that of our employees, agents or authorized representatives.</p>
