        <h1>How to use SFTP (with server validation - known hosts)</h1>
        <p>The topic <a href="howtousesftpintroduction.html">How to use SFTP (introduction</a> gives an overview of server validation. Many SSH implementations use a file called <i>known_hosts</i> which is loaded by clients 
            to validate servers. Typically, this file is generated when a command-line client first connects to a server - a prompt asks if the server should be added to the list of known hosts.
        </p>
        <p>The <i>known_hosts</i> file contains a list of approved servers and their public keys.</p>
        <p>A single line in a <i>known_hosts</i> file looks like this:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 9pt"><tt>edtmobile,10.0.0.3 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAt60CtjBMxiOOqgqfFtKZHY3g99uZpuh5E143FTO4dw+EHWNKemoWq59FMFMIZfSLyUpWmsjVT3PP1bczOXP1OSn967kxLB/w7Xr84B1ZrTLwuR/ilq73HpgO7A8pdEJN7ybprzhs5CBEgaLQo2pOxfqRYyc8TO2ADnZ1WwtjW48=</tt></p>
        <p>The first field is the hostname, i.e. the SSH server. The IP address is also listed - a number of comma separated hostnames and IP addresses can be listed.</p>
        <p>The second field is the applicable public key algorithm -"ssh-rsa" (for RSA key pairs) or "ssh-dss" (for DSA key pairs).</p>
        <p>The third field is the public key encoded using base 64. </p>
        <p>The <i>known_hosts</i> file normally consists of multiple lines, one for each of the hosts that the client may wish to connect to. It is quite typical for a host to have entries in two lines, so that 
            both RSA and DSA public keys can be listed. Note that the server may send back an RSA key or a DSA key. If <i>known_hosts</i> only contains a DSA key for the host, and an RSA key is returned, 
            <b>server validation will fail</b>. The server can be forced to send back a particular type of key as described in <a href="howtousesftpchoosingalgorithms.html">How to use SFTP (choosing algorithms)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>As noted, public keys are cached by an instance of <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html">SSHFTPValidator</a> which can be accessed through the 
            <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#getValidator%28%29">SSHFTPClient.getValidator()</a> method.
        </p>
        <p>To load the known_hosts file into the validator cache, use the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html#loadKnownHosts%28java.lang.String%29">loadKnownHosts</a> method, as shown below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#getValidator%28%29">getValidator</a>().<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html#loadKnownHosts%28java.lang.String%29">loadKnownHosts</a>(knownHostsFilePath);</code></pre>
        <p>If another <i>known_hosts</i> file is subsequently loaded via this method, its contents will be added to the current list of known hosts.</p>
        <p>To clear out the current list of known hosts, use the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html#removeAllKnownHosts%28%29">removeAllKnownHosts</a> method, e.g. </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#getValidator%28%29">getValidator</a>().<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html#removeAllKnownHosts%28%29">removeAllKnownHosts</a>();</code></pre>
        <p>The list of public keys in the cache can be retrieved by the <a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html#getKnownHosts%28%29">getKnownHosts</a> method. 
            The hashtable returned has host-names as its keys and hash-tables of algorithm-names/fingerprints as its values. 
        <p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">Hashtable cache = ftp.<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPClient.html#getValidator%28%29">getValidator</a>().<a href="../../api/com/enterprisedt/net/ftp/ssh/SSHFTPValidator.html#getKnownHosts%28%29">getKnownHosts</a>();</code></pre>
        <p>Server public keys can also be maintained in their own file and explicitly added to the validator cache. See <a href="howtousesftpwithservervalidationpublickeyfile.html">How to use SFTP (with server validation - public key files)</a>.</p>
