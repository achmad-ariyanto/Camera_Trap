        <h1>How to diagnose problems</h1>
        <p>edtFTPj/PRO has a rich API and provides complex capabilities. There are a wide
            variety of FTP, FTPS and SFTP servers in existence, which may or may not implement
            the relevant standards. 
        </p>
        <p>If difficulties are experienced in connecting to a server or performing
            operations, a number of steps can be taken to try to resolve the problem:
        </p>
        <h4>Diagnostic steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure that you can connect using a standalone FTP application such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/download.php" target="_blank"><u>FileZilla</u></a>. If you cannot
                connect with FileZilla, it is likely that other clients (such as this
                one) will also experience difficulties connecting. Make sure you select the correct protocol.
            </li>
            <li>For SFTP, alternatively (or also) use a command-line ssh client to connect
                to the server using the authentication method of your choice, and ensure that this
                works. <b>ssh -vvv </b>can be used to provide helpful debugging information.
            </li>
            <li>If you can connect using FileZilla, try using the appropriate How To
                example (with suitable settings) provided with the distribution. 
            </li>
            <li>Generate a log file exhibiting the error with the level set to <i>ALL</i>.
                This may provide you (and us) with a clue to the problem.
            </li>
            <li>If possible, obtain the server log file to see if it contains any clues to
                the problem.
            </li>
            <li>Search 
                the <a href="http://enterprisedt.com/questions/index.php/questions/products/java-ftp" target="_blank">question & answer board</a> 
                to see if the issue has been reported and a resolution posted.
                The board is searchable and contains advice and answers many common questions that developers have faced when using this library.
            </li>
            <li>Consult the product's <a href="http://enterprisedt.com/products/edtftpjssl/doc/manual/html/history.html" target="_blank">latest revision
                history</a> to see if your problem has been resolved in a later version of the software. If your support agreement is current,
                download the latest version. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If you are unable to resolve the problem and you have a current support
            agreement, you may need to <a href="support.html">contact support</a>.
