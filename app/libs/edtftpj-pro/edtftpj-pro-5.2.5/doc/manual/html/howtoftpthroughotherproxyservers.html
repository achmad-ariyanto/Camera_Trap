        <h1>How to FTP through other proxy servers</h1>
        <p>Many firewalls support a means of forming proxy connections other than SOCKS.</p>
        <p>When supplying the remote hostname, the name of the firewall is supplied instead. Instead of supplying the remote user as the user, 
            a string is supplied in the form of remoteuser@remotehost.com. The remote password is supplied as normal.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">ftp.setRemoteHost("firewallhostname");
ftp.login("remoteuser@remotehost.com","remotePassword");</code></pre>
        <p>Firewalls we have confirmed support this syntax at the time of writing include Check Point Firewall-1 and WinProxy.</p>
