    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <p>The two most common data types in usage are ASCII and binary.</p>
    <p>
        ASCII is the default data type, and is intended for the transfer of text files. A line of text is followed by 
        <CRLF>
        . Note that different operating systems use different end of line terminators.
    </p>
    <p>Binary type (known as IMAGE in FTP) is used to transfer binary files. A byte-by-byte copy is made of the source file. Graphical images, video and executable files are all binary files. 
        If they are transferred as ASCII, they will be corrupted.
