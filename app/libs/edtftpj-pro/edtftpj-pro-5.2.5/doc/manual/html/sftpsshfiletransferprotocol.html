    <h1>SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol</h1>
    <p>SFTP is an abbreviation for SSH File Transfer Protocol, and is exactly that - a protocol for transfering files over an SSH connection.</p>
    <p>Although SFTP has similar capabilities and even similar commands to standard FTP, these similarities are purely superficial. The underlying technology is completely different and incompatible with 
        FTP and its secure extension, FTPS. SFTP is not the standard FTP protocol running over SSH. 
    </p>
    <p>SCP is also a file transfer protocol that runs over SSH connections. It is a precursor to SFTP, and allows the copying of files and directories over SSH. </p>
    <p>Fortunately, edtFTPj/PRO enables you to largely gloss over these differences. In this section, we will introduce SFTP and SCP.</p>
    <p>In order to understand SFTP, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of <a href="sshsecureshell.html">SSH</a>.</p>
