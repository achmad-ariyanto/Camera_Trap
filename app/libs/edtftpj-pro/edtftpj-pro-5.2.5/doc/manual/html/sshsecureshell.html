    <h1>SSH - Secure Shell</h1>
    <p>SSH is a standard designed to allow logging in and execution of commands on a remote computer in a manner similar to telnet, rlogin, and rsh.  Unlike these protocols, 
        it does this through an encrypted network connection  thus offering a much higher level of security. 
    </p>
    <p>The first version of the standard, SSH-1, was designed in 1995 by Tatu Yl&ouml;nen.  The second version, SSH-2, is being standardized by the IETF SECSH working group.  
        It offers a higher level of security than its predecessor.
    </p>
    <p>In order for a computer to be able to accept SSH connections, it must be running an SSH server, such as <i>sshd</i>, on a publicly accessible port (usually port 22). 
        The client computer must have an SSH client, such <i>ssh</i>, and be known to the server.  A client is known to the server either by logging in as a known ssh user, 
        or by the client's public key if it has been registered with the server.  This differs significantly from SSL which relies on certificates rather than private/public key-pairs.
    </p>
    <p>Private/public key-pairs in SSH typically use either the DSA or RSA asymmetric key algorithms. Most SSH servers support both.</p>
    <p>SSH supports the use of data compression to reduce the amount of data that is transmitted. Both the client and server agree on a compression algorithm. 
        They then compress data before sending and decompress data when it is received. Typically, the <a href="http://www.zlib.net" target="_blank">zlib</a> compression algorithm is used.
    </p>
    <p>Once an SSH session has been established the user may use the console commands that are native to the remote computer.</p>
